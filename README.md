# MySunshine

It is an android and iOS application that provides the data from NASA POWER in a user-friendly interface. It displays data about solar irradiance, temperature and wind speed depending on the user's input. 
The app solves the issue of the legibility of data by streamlining all of the API's data in an efficient and accessible manner for all to use to empower individuals and local initiatives. The user can use data from any time available by the API with information being graphed into charts with the ability to manipulate said charts. Also, the user can pick the location, either automatically using the phone's built-in GPS or manually by picking the location by hand.

# Features

- The user can adjust the duration based on his needs, which can be daily, weekly or monthly.

- "*Future Update*" The app would support different locales based on what the user likes.
